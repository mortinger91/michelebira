A personal varation of the [oh my zsh bira theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme).

A two lines prompt that shows you username, current directory and current git branch (if in a git repo)  
plus a red dot if there are any uncommitted changes in the working directory.  
It also shows you the return code of the last command, if non-zero, at the right side.

It may look slighlty different based on the terminal emulator and OS.

Use it with oh my zsh.  
Copy the theme file from the repo to this directory: `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/michelebira.zsh-theme`
